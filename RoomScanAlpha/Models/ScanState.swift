///
/// - `idle`: No active scan. User can select a project or start scanning.
/// - `selectingRFQ`: User is choosing an RFQ (project) to associate with the scan.
/// - `projectOverview`: Viewing existing rooms, scope, and dimensions for the selected project.
/// - `scanReady`: AR preview visible; user sees "Start Scan" button before committing.
/// - `scanning`: AR session is active, capturing mesh and keyframes (8°/0.3s dense capture).
/// - `reviewingCoverage`: Mesh coverage analysis — shows uncovered faces before annotation.
/// - `annotatingCorners`: Scan stopped; user traces room corners on AR view.
/// - `labelingRoom`: User is tagging the room (e.g., "Kitchen").
/// - `exporting`: Packaging keyframes + mesh + metadata into the upload directory.
/// - `uploading`: Uploading the scan package to GCS and notifying the backend.
/// - `viewingResults`: Displaying cloud-computed room dimensions and detected components.
